#### Summary
<p style="font-size: 16px;">
This workshop was hosted at the University of Central Florida on November 4 and 5, 2024, and attended by 12 individuals from universities and national laboratories across the United States. 
<br><br>
During day 1 of the workshop, participants worked in small groups to develop recommendations and guidelines for team learning in the groups who collaboratively produce and use scientific software. 
To faciliate discussion on this topic, groups were provided with resources on team learning and scenarios based on real-world collaborations in which it is expected that team learning can serve to improve team performance and software outcomes. 
<br><br>
Breakout groups focused on different areas for targeting team learning, including supporting multi-team systems, leveraging artificial intelligence, and advancing social equity.
All participants met after each breakout session to present their proposals and elicit feedback.

During day 2 of the workshop, participants engaged in discussion and reflection on (1) the prior day's activities, (2) opportunities for mentorship, publications, and community engagement, and (3) maintaining a focus on the needs and requirements of scientific software teams. 
A preliminary synthesis of workshop themes and products resulted in the identification of three complementary and interdependent areas of work: general guidelines, scenario-based interventions, and tools. 
<br><br>
Workshop participants communicated the value of the workshop topic for scientific software and affirmed their commitment to continued collaboration.
Related, one publication with all workshop participants as co-authors is planned for submission to a computing science and engineering venue. 
An informal plan was established to explore other opportunities for additional publications, including, for example, extension of workshop position papers. 
<br><br>
A presentation to report on the focus and outcomes of the workshop has been submitted as part of a minisymposium proposal to SIAM CSE 2025 in collaboration with members of Sustainable Horizons Institute, Argonne National Laboratories, Sandia National Laboratories, the University of Notre Dame, and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
